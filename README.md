# Melon Tasting Reservation Scheduler
### Purpose

I took the take home challenge and it states to build a web application that users can use to search for and book a time slot. They can click the time slot to book. Once they book the time slot, the time slot will appear with "(booked)" as it is not available. They can access their bookings to see the date and the time slot they booked.
